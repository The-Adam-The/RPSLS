# RPSLS
Rock, paper, scissors with a twist! It adds two new options, 'lizard' and 'Spock'.

A simple CLI game built in Python3. 

Simply run the main.py using python3 in the command line to get it to run. 

I built/tested the game in the UNIX/MAC environment, so apologies if the terminal edits don't work as well with other CLIs.
